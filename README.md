# car-sales-prediction
Use ANN and regression to predict car sales.

This project use ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and regression to predict a certain value based on a set of inputs. In this case, based on a profile of a specific customer we want to predict the total dollar amount the customer will pay to buy a certain car: how much he or she will pay to buy a new car based on his o her profile. We start from a set of synthetic data structured in a .csv file.
